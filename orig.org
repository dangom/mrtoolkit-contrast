Questions to be answered with the use of any material you might want to
use.

Consider the single slice 2D GRE sequence:

All time values will be given in ms

1) If two tissues would have the following relaxation properties:

T1=[1300 1300] ms

T2=[ 60 100] ms

What sequence parameters should be used to see a stronger contrast
between them?

1) TR=1000ms; TE=77 ms; α=90

2) TR=1000ms; TE=160 ms; α=90

3) TR=1000ms; TE=0 ms; α=45

1) If the excitation was done only once, the signal at the time TE would
   be given by $M_{0}sin(\alpha)e^{- TE/T2}$. If you repeat the sequence
   until it reaches steady state, what will the signal be?

1) $M_{0}sin(\alpha)e^{- \frac{\text{TE}}{T2}}(1 - e^{- TR/T1})$

2) $M_{0}sin(\alpha)e^{- TE/T2}\frac{1 - e^{- TR/T1}}{1 - {cos(\alpha)e}^{- TR/T1}}$

3) $M_{0}sin(\alpha)e^{- TE/T2}$

1) Grey matter has a T1=1330ms (@ 3T), and you were imaging it with a
   TR=2000ms (standard fMRI TR), the flip angle that would generate the
   maximum signal for that tissue would be ~77°. If the tissue would
   have a longer T1 (for example if you would be imaging @ 7T), the
   optimum flip angle for the same TR would be:

1) Bigger than 77°

2) 77°

3) Smaller than 77°

1) Grey matter has a T1=1330ms (@ 3T), and you were imaging it with a
   TR=3000ms, the flip angle that would generate the maximum signal for
   that tissue would be ~84°. If the sequence would be much faster
   (thanks to multiband 6), the TR should change to:

1) Bigger than 84°

2) Remain at 84°

3) Smaller than 84°

1) If two tissues have the same T2 but different T1s of [700 1100] (WM
   and GM at 3T), then the optimum contrast when having a GRE sequence
   with TR=600ms is achieved with a 90° flip angle. When doing 3D
   encoding of a volume of 200x200x200 pixels the acquisition would last

1) 400 mins

2) 80000 mins

3) 2mins

1) To accelerate the previous acquisition the TR could be reduced to
   6ms, in which case the optimum flip angle would be

1) The same

2) Reduced

3) Increased

1) When comparing the acquisitions TR=600 and TR=6ms , the signal
   difference between the tissues with T1=700ms and T1=1100ms will be
   15.5 and 1.7 respectively. Which of the sequence has the maximum
   contrast in a given amount of time? (note that the SNR for a given
   number of averages, N_{av}, increases $\sqrt{N_{\text{av}}}$)

1) TR = 6ms

2) TR = 600ms

3) They have the same contrast

After the first attempt you can find some MATLAB Scripts to help you
interact with this tutorial can be found on:
H:\common\temporary\4Toolkit\TutorialImageContrast

Copy the folder to your desktop.

Open MATLAB, and the script Macro2.m

Make sure your current directory is that where the script Macro2.m is
located.

The code is organized into cells. You can run the code of each cell by
simply pressing ctrl+enter

You can change various parameters and rerun the code following the
instructions in the script
